# UIDAI Passive Bot Detection System
## Minor Project - College Submission

---

## 📋 Project Overview

A **UIDAI-style Aadhaar verification page** with integrated **passive bot detection** using machine learning. The system analyzes user behavior (mouse, keyboard, device signals) to distinguish real humans from automated bots without requiring additional challenges for legitimate users.

### Key Features:
- ✅ Professional UIDAI-styled login interface
- ✅ Passive behavioral telemetry collection
- ✅ XGBoost ML model for bot/human classification
- ✅ Real-time risk scoring (0-100)
- ✅ Admin dashboard with logs and analytics
- ✅ 100% local - zero cloud/Docker dependencies

## 🎯 Problem Statement

UIDAI (Aadhaar) authentication systems are frequently targeted by:
- Automated bot attacks
- Brute force login attempts
- Account takeover via credential stuffing

**Solution:** Passive bot detection that verifies users based on **behavioral biometrics** without disrupting user experience.

📊 Real-time telemetry viewer
📈 Analytics with bot/human statistics
📋 System logs of all activities

📊 Features Explained

1. Passive Telemetry Collection
// No popup, no extra steps - user doesn't notice
Collected Signals:
  ✓ Mouse: Entropy, velocity, movement patterns
  ✓ Keyboard: Typing speed, inter-keystroke timing, error rate
  ✓ Device: Screen resolution, platform, timezone
  ✓ Timing: Event loop jitter (headless browser detection)
2. Bot Detection Model
XGBoost Classifier
  Input: 11 behavioral features
  Output: Risk score (0-100)
  Decision:
    Score < 30  → ALLOW (human-like)
    30-60       → SOFT_CHALLENGE (CAPTCHA)
    > 60        → BLOCK (bot detected)
3. Admin Dashboard
Telemetry Tab:
  → See what data is being collected
  → Real-time signals visualization
  
Analytics Tab:
  → Total sessions analyzed
  → Human vs Bot ratio
  → Average risk score
  
Logs Tab:
  → All activities logged locally
  → Timestamp, log level, message
  → Filter and search (coming soon)
📈 Sample Test Cases
Test Case 1: Real Human
Inputs:
  - Natural mouse movement (varies speed)
  - Typing with natural pauses
  - Fill form over 30+ seconds
  
Expected: Risk Score ~25, ALLOWED ✅
Test Case 2: Bot Behavior
Inputs:
  - Linear, uniform mouse movement
  - Fast, consistent typing (no pauses)
  - Form fill in <5 seconds
  
Expected: Risk Score ~75, BLOCKED 🚫
Test Case 3: Admin Access
Inputs:
  - Aadhar: 37775631
  - CAPTCHA: G8
  
Expected: Opens admin dashboard ✅
